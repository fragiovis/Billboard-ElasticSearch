We would rather just, we would rather just
Let our sorrows beat, bruise, and batter us
The elevation of our craft could be miraculous
But we would rather just, we would rather just
We would rather just, we would rather just
Let our sorrows beat, bruise, and batter us
The elevation of our craft could be miraculous
But we would rather just, we would rather—

Oh, the apathy
I pray when you hear this that you get back to me
I’d rather be turning melody into masterpiecе
But I laid out a vision reminiscent of the Maccabees
'Causе I'm here to go to war with idols that just sound wack to me
The game's afoot
Consider the quality of the faith you put
In words with no meaning
Busy feenin' all over latest hooks that have you feeling good
When you really could be checking what's underneath the hood
Well, this might leave you shook
At cycles you've endured your whole life
You've been settling for less
You injected their projection 'cause their flow relieved the stress
And when their problems became your problems, you're left cleaning up the mess
You don't feel finessed?
The rose-colored glass has jagged edges, sharp to the touch
But I wield a sword, double-edged
It's mean in the clutch , it's just too much
Cognitive dissonance in a sense, it's absurd
We've been blinded to these words
Blinded to these words
They don't talk about after sex, when you have to say goodbye they don't talk about reality sinking in after every high
They don't talk about how money can't make anybody love you
They don't talk about how having everything can take everything from you
Unfaithful, ungrateful
Hateful, unstable relationships
Deadly addictions, worst afflictions
I don't think we were made for this
Superstition or unbelief
I don't think that we prayed for this
Yes, the status quo is dangerous
The status quo is dangerous, ah
You might also like
Ooh, cool it down, cool it down, cool it down
Na-na-na-na
The status quo is dangerous
The status quo is dangerous, ah
Once again, we lift up our hands to the all-knowing God

We would rather just, we would rather just
Let our sorrows beat, bruise, and batter us
The elevation of our craft could be miraculous
But we would rather just, we would rather just
We would rather just, we would rather just
Let our sorrows beat, bruise, and batter us
The elevation of our craft could be miraculous
But we would rather just, we would rather just

Man, what's the meaning of all this corrosion?
Vendettas, evil agendas, they were Ill-chosen
Sin keeps whispering, birthing commotion
Negligence and ignorance are tightly interwoven
Suppressing this new birth my Father seeks to bestow me with
Bleeding out, all the while writing theses on oxytocin
Contradictions, irregularities in my approach meant
The deceptions and conspiracies made further encroachments, uh
Between covers budded seeds of pure destruction
Plucked the sanctity of marriage out and tried to deconstruct it
An evil notion, twisted quotients made a false deduction
Found novelty of sex at my expense when I was younger
Back when I was younger, post-sleeping on the bunker
I was cavalier, rocked a fade like Iman Shumpert
I need a new cluster 'cause your fruit can cure hunger
And all them grapes of wrath I had had me six under
Heavenly structure shatters
Weak, beat, bruised and scattered
What's the matter? We want more full course platters
And there after, deal with the disaster
Hoping to heal what I've torn running between these two masters
Such was thus discussed between my soul and mammon
They've been unstable characters
Now I'm amidst a famine, consequences examined
And then what happened?
I felt defenseless, but pride's a temptress
So who could fathom what I did next with my free actions?
Had me locked and bounded, further confounded
Endlessly surrounded, till I treaded the mountain
And what I found is, despite all past wickedness
My God could still surmount it, I was honestly astounded
Now I tote a pen, a fountain, to etch this fountain of words
He's abounding in the center of my rifts, hooks, bars, bridges, and choruses
Such is the beauty of deliverance
Trusting in Him enhances how i deliver thisEmbed

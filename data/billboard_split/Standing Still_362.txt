Cutting through the darkest night are my two headlights
Trying to keep it clear, but I'm losing it here  to the twilight
There's a dead end to my left, there's a burning bush to my right
You aren't in sight
You aren't in sight

Do you want me
Like I want you?

Or am I standing still
Beneath a darkened sky?
Or am I standing still
With the scenery flying by?
Or am I standing still?
Out of the corner of my eye
Was that you passing me by?

Mothers on the stoop, boys in souped-up coupes on this hot summer night
Between fight and flight, is the blind man's sight and a choice that's right
I roll the window down, feel like I'm gonna drown in this strange town
Feel broken down, ah
I feel broken down
You might also like
Do you need me
Like I need you?

Or am I standing still
Beneath a darkened sky?
Or am I standing still
With the scenery flying by?
Or am I standing still?
Out of the corner of my eye
Was that you passing me by?

Sweet sorrow—he said, "Call tomorrow"
Sweet sorrow—he said, "Call tomorrow"

Do you love me
Like I love you?

Or am I standing still
Beneath a darkened sky?
Or am I standing still
With the scenery flying by?
Or am I standing still?
Out of the corner of my eye
Was that you passing me by?
Are you passing me by?
Passing me by
(Do you want me?)
Passing me by
Do you need me like I need you too?
(Passing me by)
Do you want me like I want you
(Passing me by)
Or are you passing me by?
Or am I standing still?
